# 52 Weeks of Code

52 Weeks of Code is my attempt to ship one small coding project every week for a year.

The challenge is about consistency, experimentation, and learning by doing. It doesn’t matter if a project is tiny, experimental, unfinished, or overly ambitious. The point is to build, ship, learn, repeat, and improve through iteration.

This is my structured way to grow as a frontend-focused creative technologist by producing small, self-contained projects that develop my technical range, design instincts, and problem-solving ability.

## Purpose

- Build real, repeatable coding habits
- Strengthen fundamentals in UI, state, and interaction logic
- Explore creative tooling, visual coding, and system thinking
- Reduce fear of “unfinished” work by shipping something every week
- Document progress publicly for accountability and momentum

Each project has intentionally limited scope. Constraints keep the focus on execution and learning, not perfection.

## Format

Every week includes:
- A scoped project (finished or at least functional)
- A write-up about what I built and why
- A live demo hosted via GitHub Pages
- A short post-mortem

## Guiding Principles

- Consistency beats intensity
- Small projects compound over time
- Readable code is better than clever code
- State first, rendering second
- Mutate with intent
- Keep logic isolated, modular, and testable

## Tech Focus Areas

Throughout the year, I aim to reinforce:
- Frontend architecture (React, Canvas, DOM APIs, and others)
- Creative coding and generative systems
- Interaction design patterns
- Geometry and math for UI tooling
- Modular utilities and clean structure
- Testing fundamentals with Vitest
- Deployment, documentation, and project hygiene

## About Me

I’m Anders Hofsten — a junior frontend developer currently building my own structure and momentum through practical weekly projects. I enjoy working on interactive tools, visual systems, and UI/UX experiments, and I want to develop the skillset to create them independently.

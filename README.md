# 52-weeks-of-code
52 weeks of code is my attemp at doing some code thing per week for a year.

A year-long challenge to ship some sort of code thing once per week for a year, focusing on consistency, skill-building, and hands-on experimentation.

The goal is simple:  
**Build. Ship. Learn. Repeat.**
It doesn't matter what it is, nor if it is finished or not (hopefully it is though heh). The idea is to try and learn and explore concepts, improve with iteration, experimentation and repetition, while learning new concepts, patterns and just have fun in general.

This challenge is my structured way to level up as a frontend-focused creative technologist by producing small, self-contained projects that improve my technical range, design instincts, and problem-solving ability.

## Purpose

- Build real, tangible coding habits  
- Strengthen fundamentals in UI, interaction logic, and architecture  
- Explore creative tooling, visual coding, system design, and have fun! 
- Reduce fear of “unfinished” work by shipping every week, no matter what state project is in 
- Document progress publicly for accountability and momentum, even it's super scary and I suck at coding HAHA  

Each project is intentionally limited in scope — the constraint keeps the focus on execution and learning, not perfection.

## Format

Every week includes:

- A small scoped project — self-contained and shippable (hopefully fully working, or at the least a working prototype)  
- A writeup covering what I built and why
- A live demo hosted via GitHub Pages  
- A post-mortem with quick reflections  

## Guiding Principles

- Consistency beats intensity  
- Small projects compound  
- Readable code over clever code  
- State first, rendering second  
- Mutate with intent  
- Keep logic isolated and testable  

## Tech Focus Areas

Over the year, the challenge reinforces:

- Frontend architecture (React, Canvas, DOM APIs, whatever else I will venture into as the year goes by)  
- Fundamentals in creative coding and generative systems 
- Interaction design patterns  
- Geometry and math for UI tooling  
- Reusable utilities and clean modularization  
- Testing fundamentals with Vitest (hopefully, I know we all hate writing tests) 
- Deployment, CI, documentation

## About Me

I’m **Anders Hofsten** — A juniiiior frontend developer with too much to spare at the moment. 
I like interactive tools, visual systems, and practical UI/UX experiments, and would like to build them too.
